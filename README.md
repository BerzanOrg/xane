## Setup A Development Environment
The easiest way to setup a development environment is to use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). <br>
You just need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed to use [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/). <br>
When you open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it will warn you to repeon it in a container. <br>
It also contains three [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions that will help you during the development.

If you prefer a more traditional way to setup a development environment, you only need to install the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
